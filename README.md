##Game Of

This is a video sharing, scorekeeping chat game originally tailored for those in extreme sports.

The game can be continued for those who do any sport and I would like to evolve it as such so users can create their own games.

Policing scores and how the game works will be fairly problematic, and features such as editing video lenght like in WhatsApp will be troublesome but that is a goal of mine.

I think realistically, the code will be similar to that of WhatsApp so exploring this will be advantageous.

In terms of monetising, this will have to be figured out later on.
